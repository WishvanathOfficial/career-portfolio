## Layout and concept

### 1. Desktop Screenshots
The main view transitions smoothly when a new page is selected from the sidebar, giving a page-flipping effect. The sidebar is also toggleable, allowing the content area to expand for a larger viewing space.

### 2. Mobile Screenshots
On mobile, the layout groups the portfolio sections into categories and transforms into a tabbed interface with a bottom navigation.
